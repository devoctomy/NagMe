This is an early preview release of NagMe, the Windows reminder assistant.

It's designed to allow numerous customised reminders that interrupt your time sitting at the screen to attend to other issues, such as posture breaks, eye care, stretches and other activities.

This version allows the following

* Configuring of custom reminders
    - Customised frequency and display time
    - Simple windows message box reminders
    - Full screen reminders
* AI Integration (ChatGPT)
    - Generated full screen alert titles and messages

## TODO:

    - Whisper integration to speak the reminder message
    - DAL-E integration for full screen background image
    - Alert queuing to handle overlapping reminder alerts

## Known Issues:

    - Multiple reminders configured may overlap
